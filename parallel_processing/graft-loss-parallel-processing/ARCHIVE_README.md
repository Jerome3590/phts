# Archived: graft-loss-parallel-processing

## Status: ARCHIVED

This directory has been archived as of the R script reorganization. It contains historical development code, parallel processing implementations, and documentation from earlier iterations of the pipeline.

**Location**: This archive is now located in `parallel_processing/graft-loss-parallel-processing/` (renamed from `archive/` for clarity).

## Contents

- **scripts/R/**: Parallel processing implementations and utilities
- **original_study/**: Original study replication scripts
- **backup/**: Backup versions of scripts
- **model_setup/**: Model setup documentation
- **pipeline/**: Pipeline orchestration scripts
- **README.md**: Parallel processing documentation

## Why Archived?

- Not actively referenced by main pipeline scripts (`graft-loss/scripts/`)
- Contains many duplicate scripts that exist in main directories
- Historical/development code preserved for reference
- Reduces confusion about which scripts are active

## Current Active Code

The active pipeline code is now in:
- `graft-loss/scripts/` - Main pipeline scripts
- `graft-loss/R/` - Utility functions

## Accessing Archived Code

If you need to reference code from this archive:
1. Check if functionality exists in main directories first
2. If not found, reference this archive
3. Consider moving unique functionality to main directories if needed

## Date Archived

Archived during R script reorganization to improve project structure and clarity.
